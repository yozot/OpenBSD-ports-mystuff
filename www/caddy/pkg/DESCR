Caddy is most often used as an HTTPS server, but it is suitable for any long-running Go program.
First and foremost, it is a platform to run Go applications. Caddy "apps" are just Go programs that
are implemented as Caddy modules. Two apps -- tls and http -- ship standard with Caddy.

Caddy apps instantly benefit from automated documentation, graceful on-line config changes via API,
and unification with other Caddy apps.

Although JSON is Caddy's native config language, Caddy can accept input from config adapters which
can essentially convert any config format of your choice into JSON: Caddyfile, JSON 5, YAML, TOML,
NGINX config, and more.

The primary way to configure Caddy is through its API, but if you prefer config files, the
command-line interface supports those too.
