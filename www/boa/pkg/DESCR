Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that unlike traditional
web servers, it does not fork for each incoming connection, nor does it
fork many copies of itself to handle multiple connections. It
internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and forks
only for CGI programs (which must be separate processes.)
