Is there anyone doing phonetics on OpenBSD?
Is there an alternative to Praat, to be run on OpenBSD?
(At this stage of phonetics studies, I imagine Praat
is the one tool everyone is using.)

There is a FreeBSD port, so I installed FreeBSD on a spare laptop
and instralled praat on it, but couldn't get it to work (basicaly,
it just crashes on anything, including opening a wav file).

Is anyone working on a port of Praat?
Or some other "equivalent"?
What do you use?

	Thank you

		Jan


PS: I am sending this to ports@ as this is probably too far from base,
as oppposed to a XKB layout for an IPA kayboard and X fonts having the
glyphs, which I sent to misc@. Please correct me it that's a bad choice.
