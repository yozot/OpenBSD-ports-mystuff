RaptorQ is an implementation of a class of systematic erasure codes called
fountain codes.

The data we want to send is split into blocks, and then pre-encoded into a set
of intermediate symbols.  From these intermediate symbols we can generate both
our original source symbols, and also additional repair symbols.

Provided the recipient receives at least a minimum value K' of these symbols
(any unique combination of source and repair) the intermediate symbols can be
reconstituted, and the original data recovered.

RaptorQ is what is called a systematic encoding, because the set of symbols we
send includes our original data as plain text. Provided all source symbols are
received, the original data has been transmitted with no decoding overhead.
It is only in the case where we need to supplement the source symbols with
repair symbols that we must perform the decoding process.
