This is a small library providing a socket-like API for librecast communication.

Librecast is a project to provide fast, efficient and scalable communication by
leveraging IPv6 multicast.
This work is dual-licensed under GPL 2.0 and GPL 3.0.

You can probably figure most things out by looking at the tests and header
files. There are code samples in test/ that will show you how to do the most
common things.

Remember to link your program with -llibrecast. If you're using librecast/db.h
and librecast/netdb.h you'll also need -llsdb and -llcdb respectively.
