Poly/ML is a Standard ML implementation originally written in an experimental
language called Poly. It has been fully compatible with the ML97 standard since
version 4.0.

Poly/ML takes a conservative approach to the Standard ML language and avoids
incompatible extensions. It has added various library extensions particularly
the thread library.

The documentation for the Poly/ML Basis library can be found at
<https://www.polyml.org/documentation/Reference/Basis.html> and includes
information on global values and types as well as structures, signatures and
functors.
More in-depth documentation can be found at the SML Family website
<https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/manpages.html>.
