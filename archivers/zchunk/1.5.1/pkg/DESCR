zchunk is a compressed file format that splits the file into independent chunks.
This allows you to only download changed chunks when downloading a new version
of the file.  Files can hosted on any web server that supports HTTP ranged
requests, with no special software required to serve the files (though to
download only the changed chunks, your client must be zchunk-aware).

zchunk files are protected with strong checksums to verify that the file you
downloaded is, in fact, the file you wanted.

To decompress a zchunk file, simply run:
unzck <filename>

To compress a new zchunk file, run:
zck <filename>

To download a zchunk file, run:
zckdl -s <source> <url of target>

To read a zchunk header, run:
zck_read_header <file>
