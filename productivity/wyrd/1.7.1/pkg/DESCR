Wyrd is a text-based front-end to
[Remind](https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/), a sophisticated
calendar and alarm program serving two purposes:

1. It displays reminders in a scrollable timetable view suitable
   for visualizing your calendar at a glance.
2. It makes creating and editing reminders fast and easy.
   However, Wyrd does not hide Remind's textfile programmability,
   for this is what makes Remind a truly powerful calendaring system.

Wyrd also requires only a fraction of the resources of most calendar
programs available today.
