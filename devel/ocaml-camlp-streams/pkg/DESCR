The camlp-streams package provides two library modules:

 * Stream: imperative streams, with in-place update and memoization of
           the latest element produced.
 * Genlex: a small parameterized lexical analyzer producing streams of
           tokens from streams of characters.

The two modules are designed for use with Camlp4 and Camlp5:

 * The stream patterns and stream expressions of Camlp4/Camlp5 consume and
   produce data of type 'a Stream.t.
 * The Genlex tokenizer can be used as a simple lexical analyzer for
   Camlp4/Camlp5-generated parsers.

The Stream module can also be used by hand-written recursive-descent parsers,
but is not very convenient for this purpose.
