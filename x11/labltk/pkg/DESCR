LablTk is an OCaml interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI framework.
It allows to develop GUI applications in a speedy and type safe way.
It was derived from the CamlTk project, and a legacy CamlTk API is included.
The OCamlBrowser library viewer is also part of this project.

LablTk provides a strongly-typed, yet comfortable, interface
to Tcl/Tk's widgets through OCaml's rich type system. Most
widgets and methods are available, along with many examples.

The toplevel can be used for interactive development.
