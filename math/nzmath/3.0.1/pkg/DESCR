NZMATH is a Python calculator on number theory. It is freely available and
distributed under the BSD license. All programs are written only by Python so
that you can easily see their algorithmic number theory.

This release contains several program corrections and additions obtained by
writing a programming "notebook" of the book 'Lectures on Elementary Number
Theory' (TAKAGI, Teiji) in Python-NZMATH language. The "notebook" itself is
also available together with NZMATH calculator. It is designed for beginning
students on algorithmic number theory to self-study Number Theory, Programming
and scientific English together. It is possible only by running and reading the
programs. You can get the "notebook" here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/
nzmath/files/nzmath-enttakagi/

NZMATH is provided as a Python library package named 'nzmath', so please use it
as a usual package. For more information please refer Tutorial.
