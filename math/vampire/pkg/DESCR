Vampire is a theorem prover.  More precisely, it proves theorems in first-order logic.

Here are a few facts about Vampire:
  - Vampire is very fast
  - Vampire has a easy to use portfolio mode (see https://vprover.github.io/usage.html)
    that can be run in multicore mode
  - Vampire can "pretend to be an SMT solver" in the sense that it accepts SMT-LIB input and
    can effectively reason in combinations of first-order logic and theories, such as
    integer arithmetic, which makes it useful for reasoning with theories and quantifiers
  - Vampire can produce detailed proofs and finite models
  - Vampire supports algebraic data types (finite term algebras)
  - Vampire can generate interpolants
