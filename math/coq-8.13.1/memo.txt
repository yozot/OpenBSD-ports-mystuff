coq-8.13.1/configure.ml is updated from 8.12
to check the availability of lablgtk3 using ocamlfind, and
it cannot find lablgtk3. (see "ocamlfind list | grep lablgtk3")

The reason is, META file of lablgtk3-3.1.1 does not have version information.
META file comes from dune-project (or opam files for each project) in lablgtk3 source code,
and dune-project does not have version information.

With the patch to lablgtk3 3.1.1 port to add version information,
I confirmed that coq-8.13.1 can be packaged on amd64 current.
(see ../x11/lablgtk3-3.1.1/)

TODO: try package on non-ocaml-native system
TODO: pull request to lablgtk3 project.
