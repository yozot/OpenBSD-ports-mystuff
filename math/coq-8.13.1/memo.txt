coq-8.13.1/configure.ml is updated from 8.12
to check the availability of lablgtk3 using ocamlfind, and
it cannot find lablgtk3. (see "ocamlfind list | grep lablgtk3")

The reason is, META file of lablgtk3-3.1.1 does not have version information.
META file comes from dune-project (or opam files for each project) in lablgtk3 source code,
and dune-project does not have version information.

I found that OpenBSD ports for several ocaml software use the wrong source code tar balls.
see
    - #123: version information into dune-project (lablgtk3)
      https://github.com/garrigue/lablgtk/issues/123

    - ports: dune dependant ports should use the right source tarballs

TODO: revise ocaml-cairo and lablgtk3 ports to use *.tbz tarballs
TODO: try package on non-ocaml-native system
