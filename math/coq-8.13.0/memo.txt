coq-8.13.0/configure.ml is updated from the previous version
to check the availability of lablgtk3 using ocamlfind, and
it cannot find lablgtk3. (see "ocamlfind list | grep lablgtk3")

The reason is, META file of lablgtk3-3.1.0 does not have version information,
which comes from dune-project (or opam files for each project) in lablgtk3 source code
does not have version information.
Here is a try to update lablgtk3 to 3.1.1 with a patch to add version information.

I confirmed that coq-8.13.0 can be packaged on amd64 current.

TODO: try package on non-ocaml-native system
TODO: pull request to lablgtk3 project.
